# Hi there! 👋

I'm an **Industrial Engineering student** with a strong passion for **automation**. If something needs to be done for 1 minute every day, I'd happily spend a week automating it. 🚀


## About Me:
- 🔧 I specialize in automating repetitive tasks and making workflows more efficient.
- 💻 Always working on **personal projects** that challenge my coding and problem-solving skills.
- 🤖 Sometimes I get lost in abstraction – I tend to rewrite code before it's even finished, creating a never-ending cycle like **Sisyphus** pushing the boulder. 🌀
- 🎯 Still, I strive to improve every day and break out of that cycle.
